# CG_Class_Courseware

This project includes solutions of the homeworks in computer graphics course in Software Collage, Nankai University.<br>
They are all written in markdown files because they didn't obey the coding standard in engineering. So please rewrite the code to obey them. (maybe I will correct them if I have time later) <br>

There is also a directory includes some gardgets written in cplusplus files.<br>

If you have any problem, feel free to contact me using `Issues` in github.<br>
